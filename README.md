# AI-Text-to-Image-Generator
This repository contains an AI-powered Text-to-Image Generator built using Stable Diffusion v1.5. Developed as part of my IBM Internship, the project enables users to convert natural language prompts into high-quality images with the help of Hugging Faceâ€™s Diffusers, PyTorch, and Transformers libraries.
